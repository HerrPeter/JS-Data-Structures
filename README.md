# Welcome to the JS-Data-Structures wiki! #

To better understand JavaScript/ES6, I'm working to create all types of data structures that I may need in my future JS development adventures. Feel free to learn from, criticise, or compliment any of the code I write. I have written most of these data structures and sort methods in C++ for a class, but never took the time to master them - hence why I'm doing this on my winter break.

I will attempt to keep my implementations up to date with ES6, but realize some of the limitations with Node.js (i.e. import/export keywords).

## Data Structures:
- [x] [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/HerrPeterr/JS-Data-Structures/blob/master/JS%20Data%20Structures/Data%20Structs/Linked%20Lists.js)
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [ ] Red Black Tree (RBT)

## Sort:
- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Selection Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quicksort

## List Search:
- [ ] Binary Search (May consider implementing in list like structures)

## Graph Search:
- [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)
- [ ] Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (DJ)
- [ ] A* Algorithm (A*)
- [ ] Bellman-Ford Algorithm (BF)

## Security:
_Cryptography section implementation in consideration_
